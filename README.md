🎵 SimSample
Find similar sounds in your sample library instantly. Upload your audio samples and discover musically similar tracks using AI-powered audio fingerprinting.

🧠 The Story
Built by a music producer who got tired of manually digging through sample folders looking for "that one kick that sounds like the one in my reference track."

Started as a simple script, evolved into a full-scale production system that handles the real-world challenges of audio processing at scale - memory constraints, large file uploads, and the need for actually usable search results.

What It Does
As a music producer, manually browsing through hundreds of samples to find a specific sound is time-consuming and frustrating. SimSample solves this by letting you:

Upload your sample library (drag & drop folders, any size)
Drop in a reference track (the sound you're looking for)
Get instant results (similar samples ranked by audio similarity)
Perfect for producers who want to find samples that match the vibe of their favorite tracks.

🎯 Key Features
🎵 Audio Similarity Search: Upload a reference sample and find similar sounds in your library
📁 Large Library Support: Handles 500MB+ sample collections automatically
⚡ Fast Results: Sub-second similarity search once processed
🏗️ Smart Processing: Automatically chunks large uploads to handle any library size
📱 Clean Interface: Drag & drop uploads with real-time progress tracking
🔄 Auto-Retry: Handles cloud startup issues gracefully
🛠️ Technical Highlights
Built to handle real-world music production workflows with enterprise-grade architecture:

Audio Processing: MFCC feature extraction using librosa for perceptual similarity
Search Engine: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for instant vector similarity queries
Scalable Architecture: Chunked batch processing to overcome cloud memory constraints
Production Deployment: Google Cloud Run with automatic scaling and error handling
Frontend: React with real-time progress tracking and responsive design
Architecture Overview
Sample Upload → Chunked Processing → Audio Fingerprinting → FAISS Index → Instant Search
     ↓              ↓                     ↓                 ↓            ↓
[Large Files] → [Batch System] → [MFCC Features] → [Vector DB] → [Real-time Query]
Technical Challenge Solved: Processing 400+ audio files (500MB+) in cloud environments with strict memory limits through distributed batch architecture.

🎬 How It Works
Upload: Drag and drop your sample folder - automatically chunks large libraries
Processing: Extracts audio fingerprints using MFCC analysis in the background
Search: Upload any reference track and get similar samples ranked by audio similarity
Discover: Find samples you forgot you had or discover new creative combinations
🎵 Perfect For
Music Producers: Find similar drums, bass lines, or melodic elements
Sample Diggers: Organize and explore large sample collections
Beat Makers: Discover creative combinations and variations
Audio Enthusiasts: Explore how audio similarity algorithms work
